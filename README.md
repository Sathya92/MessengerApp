# MessengerApp
Developed a Messenger backend which provides RESTful Services implemented in Java using Jersey framework. This REST API allows the user to post messages, comments and maintain user profiles. Comments are linked to the messages, so the comments for the corresponding message can be posted, updated, accessed and deleted.
